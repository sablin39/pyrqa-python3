# PyRQA

General Information
-------------------

PyRQA is a tool to conduct recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) and to create recurrence plots in a massively parallel manner using the OpenCL framework.
It is designed to process very long time series consisting of hundreds of thousands of data points efficiently.

PyRQA supports the computation of the following RQA measures:

    - Recurrence Rate (RR)
    - Determinism (DET)
    - Average diagonal line length (L)
    - Longest diagonal line (L_max)
    - Divergence (DIV)
    - Entropy diagonal lines (L_entr)
    - Laminarity (LAM)
    - Trapping time (TT)
    - Longest vertical line (V_max)
    - Entropy vertical lines (V_entr)
    - Average white vertical line length (W)
    - Longest white vertical line (W_max)
    - Entropy white vertical lines (W_entr)

In addition, PyRQA allows to compute the thresholded recurrence matrix as well as to save the corresponding recurrence plot as an image file.

Install
-------

PyRQA can be installed via::

    $ pip install PyRQA

Requirements
------------

To run PyRQA on OpenCL devices (such as GPUs and CPUs), it may be required to install hardware vendor specific software, e.g., device drivers.
Regarding the latest versions of MacOS X, OpenCL support should be available by default.

Software and information regarding selected vendors can be found at:

    - AMD: http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/opencl-zone/
    - Intel: https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/opencl-drivers
    - NVIDIA: https://developer.nvidia.com/opencl

Usage
-----

RQA computations can be conducted using::

    >>> from pyrqa.settings import Settings
    >>> from pyrqa.neighbourhood import FixedRadius
    >>> from pyrqa.metric import EuclideanMetric
    >>> from pyrqa.computation import RQAComputation
    >>> time_series = [0.1, 0.5, 0.3, 1.7, 0.8, 2.4, 0.6, 1.2, 1.4, 2.1, 0.8]
    >>> settings = Settings(time_series,
                            embedding_dimension=3,
                            time_delay=1,
                            neighbourhood=FixedRadius(1.0),
                            similarity_measure=EuclideanMetric,
                            theiler_corrector=1,
                            min_diagonal_line_length=2,
                            min_vertical_line_length=2,
                            min_white_vertical_line_length=2)
    >>> computation = RQAComputation.create(settings, verbose=True)
    >>> result = computation.run()
    >>> print result

Recurrence plot computations can be conducted likewise. Building on the previous example::

    >>> from pyrqa.computation import RecurrencePlotComputation
    >>> from pyrqa.image_generator import ImageGenerator
    >>> computation = RecurrencePlotComputation.create(settings)
    >>> result = computation.run()
    >>> ImageGenerator.save_recurrence_plot(result.recurrence_matrix_reverse, 'recurrence_plot.png')

Moreover, it is possible to read time series data that is stored column-wise from a file, e.g.,::

    >>> from pyrqa.file_reader import FileReader
    >>> time_series = FileReader.file_as_float_array('data.csv',
                                                     delimiter=';',
                                                     column=0)

The previous examples use the default OpenCL environment. To create a custom environment using command line input, use::

    >>> from pyrqa.opencl import OpenCL
    >>> opencl = OpenCL(command_line=True)

In addition, the OpenCL platform as well as the computing devices can be selected using their IDs, e.g.::

    >>> opencl = OpenCL(platform_id=0, device_ids=(0,))

To use the custom environment, replace the default OpenCL object, e.g.,::

    >>> computation.opencl = opencl

or create a new computation object, e.g.,::

    >>> computation = RQAComputation.create(settings, opencl=opencl, verbose=True)

Environment
-----------

This library has been tested under Python 3.10 on Ubuntu 22.04 x86_64 with kernel version 5.15.0-126-generic. 

Benchmark
-----------
It takes approximately 120 seconds to run all tests on single Nvidia RTX3090 with driver verion 555.42.06.

Contribution
------------

PyRQA is the result of the work of computer scientists at the Humboldt University of Berlin and the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences.
